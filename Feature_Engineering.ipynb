        "- Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model.\n",
        "- It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.\n",
        "- When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The steps used in data preprocessing include the following:\n",
        "- Data profiling\n",
        "- Data profiling is the process of examining, analyzing and reviewing data to collect statistics about its quality.\n",
        "- Data cleansing.\n",
        "- Data reduction.\n",
        "- Data transformation.\n",
        "- Data validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data preprocessing transforms the data into a format that is more easily and effectively processed in data mining, machine learning and other data science tasks.\n",
        "- The techniques are generally used at the earliest stages of the machine learning and AI development pipeline to ensure accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### There are several different tools and methods used for preprocessing data, including the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data;\n",
        "- transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input;\n",
        "- denoising, which removes noise from data;\n",
        "- imputation, which synthesizes statistically relevant data for missing values;\n",
        "- normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access; and\n",
        "- feature extraction, which pulls out a relevant feature subset that is significant in a particular context.\n",
        "- These tools and methods can be used on a variety of data sources, including data stored in files or databases and streaming data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is data preprocessing important?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Machine learning and deep learning algorithms work best when data is presented in a format that highlights the relevant aspects required to solve a problem.\n",
        "- Feature engineering practices that involve data wrangling, data transformation, data reduction, feature selection and feature scaling help restructure raw data into a form suited for particular types of algorithms.\n",
        "- This can significantly reduce the processing power and time required to train a new machine learning or AI algorithm or run an inference against it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data preprocessing techniques\n",
        "- There are two main categories of preprocessing -- data cleansing and feature engineering. Each includes a variety of techniques, as detailed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data cleansing\n",
        "- Techniques for cleaning up messy data include the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Identify and sort out missing data.\n",
        "- There are a variety of reasons a data set might be missing individual fields of data.\n",
        "- Data scientists need to decide whether it is better to discard records with missing fields, ignore them or fill them in with a probable value.\n",
        "- For example, in an IoT application that records temperature, adding in a missing average temperature between the previous and subsequent record might be a safe fix.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reduce noisy data. Real-world data is often noisy, which can distort an analytic or AI model.\n",
        "- For example, a temperature sensor that consistently reported a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit might erroneously report a temperature as 250 degrees.\n",
        "- A variety of statistical approaches can be used to reduce the noise, including binning, regression and clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Identify and remove duplicates. When two records seem to repeat, an algorithm needs to determine if the same measurement was recorded twice, or the records represent different events.\n",
        "- In some cases, there may be slight differences in a record because one field was recorded incorrectly.\n",
        "- In other cases, records that seem to be duplicates might indeed be different, as in a father and son with the same name who are living in the same house but should be represented as separate individuals.\n",
        "- Techniques for identifying and removing or joining duplicates can help to automatically address these types of problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Feature engineering\n",
        "- Feature engineering, as noted, involves techniques used by data scientists to organize the data in ways that make it more efficient to train data models and run inferences against them.\n",
        "- These techniques include the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Feature scaling or normalization. Often, multiple variables change over different scales, or one will change linearly while another will change exponentially.\n",
        "- For example, salary might be measured in thousands of dollars, while age is represented in double digits.\n",
        "- Scaling helps to transform the data in a way that makes it easier for algorithms to tease apart a meaningful relationship between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Data reduction.\n",
        "- Data scientists often need to combine a variety of data sources to create a new AI or analytics model.\n",
        "- Some of the variables may not be correlated with a given outcome and can be safely discarded.\n",
        "- Other variables might be relevant, but only in terms of relationship -- such as the ratio of debt to credit in the case of a model predicting the likelihood of a loan repayment; they may be combined into a single variable.\n",
        "- Techniques like principal component analysis play a key role in reducing the number of dimensions in the training data set into a more efficient representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Discretization.\n",
        "- It's often useful to lump raw numbers into discrete intervals.\n",
        "- For example, income might be broken into five ranges that are representative of people who typically apply for a given type of loan.\n",
        "- This can reduce the overhead of training a model or running inferences against it.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Feature encoding.\n",
        "- Another aspect of feature engineering involves organizing unstructured data into a structured format.\n",
        "- Unstructured data formats can include text, audio and video.\n",
        "- For example, the process of developing natural language processing algorithms typically starts by using data transformation algorithms like Word2vec to translate words into numerical vectors.\n",
        "- This makes it easy to represent to the algorithm that words like \"mail\" and \"parcel\" are similar, while a word like \"house\" is completely different.\n",
        "- Similarly, a facial recognition algorithm might reencode raw pixel data into vectors representing the distances between parts of the face."

        "- The moral of the example as if the apples every apple in the shop is good we will take less time to purchase or if the apples are not good enough we will take more time in the selection process which means that if the values of attributes are closer we will work faster and the chances of selecting good apples also strong.\n",

        "- The machine learning models provide weights to the input variables according to their data points and inferences for output. -  - In that case, if the difference between the data points is so high, the model will need to provide the larger weight to the points and in final results, the model with a large weight value is often unstable.\n",
